Declarations are the LEFT SIDE of a variable.
    It is simply the var x
    It is on the left side of the assignment operator (=)
    
Initializations are the RIGHT SIDE of a variable
    It set the value of the variable 
    It incorporates the variable name (x), the assignment operator (=), and the value(10) => x=10
    (=) assignment operator is NOT the same as the equal operator (== or ===)
