//* JS reads through our code twice. The first time, it looks for the left hand side of variables and functions
//* (the declarations). The second pass, it reads through the right hand side, and assigns values and expressions.
//* We call it "hoisting" because JS keeps those variable names stored in memory for quicker reference later.
